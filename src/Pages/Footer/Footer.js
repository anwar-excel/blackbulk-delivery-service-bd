                <p>My delivery can be intense, but it's intense because  I need to be heard. I know that people <br /> don't usually  listen, as it relates to constructive criticism, without getting offended. So,<br /> I speak my mind with an attitude  that I don't care if you get offended; br
                    I just want you to get the message.
